I changed it so that the formatting is correct for notepad on windows 11. The screenshot titled OutputFile.png
was a screenshot when it was formatted for the Vim edditor. I assume you will probably be grading it based
on appearance in notepad so I changed it. If this is an issue please reach out and I can fix it.
